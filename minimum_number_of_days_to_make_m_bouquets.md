- **Algorithm:** binary search
- **Type:** array

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer arrayÂ bloomDay, an integerÂ mÂ and an integerÂ k.

You want to makeÂ mÂ bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to useÂ kÂ adjacent flowersÂ from the garden.
The garden consists ofÂ nÂ flowers, theÂ ithÂ flower will bloom in theÂ bloomDay[i]Â and then can be used inÂ exactly oneÂ bouquet.

ReturnÂ the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to makeÂ mÂ bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make m bouquets returnÂ -1.

## Constraints

 
- bloomDay.length == n
- 1 <= n <= 105
- 1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 109
- 1 <= m <= 106
- 1 <= k <= n

## Solution

- **Status:** Needed Hints

### Solution Notes

I was able to solve the problem with the hints. It actually just came to me but it was a bit late. The aspect I was missing was how to find the groups of flowers that could make a valid bouquet. I was struggling how to keep track of the flowers because I had a major flaw in my logic.

I kept thinking I needed to restart the bloomDay loop for a given day, but there is no need as I would have already qualified the flowers in previous indices. It finally occurred to me that I could just keep track of how many adjacent flowers were valid and then track if I have enough for a valid bouquet. 

I should not have taken so long to come to this. Not good ğŸ˜Ÿ


```go
package main

func minDays(bloomDay []int, m int, k int) int {
	if len(bloomDay) < m*k {
		return -1
	}
	l, r := 0, 1000000000
	minDays := 0
	for l <= r {
		mid := l + (r-l)/2
		if b := bouquetsAtDay(bloomDay, k, mid); b < m {
			l = mid + 1
		} else {
			minDays = mid
			r = mid - 1
		}
	}
	return minDays
}

func bouquetsAtDay(bloomDay []int, k, day int) int {
	mcount, kcount := 0, 0
	for i := 0; i < len(bloomDay); i++ {
		if bloomDay[i] <= day {
			kcount++
		} else {
			kcount = 0
		}
		if kcount == k {
			mcount++
			kcount = 0
		}
	}
	return mcount
}
```
