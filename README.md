# Practice Problems

## Justification

Practice problems are those that improve the dev mind in a general sense. In a daily job, one tends to only work on small scope of things at once. Working on practice problems keeps one sharp and less exposed to the mundane and repetition. Secondary benefits can be around interviewing and solving problems under pressure, but these can only really be realized when done in the proper setting, such as mock interviews or timed competitive programming.

## Meaning

This repo is meant to be a central hub for where I will keep the templates related to the problems I do. The cadance could be daily, weekly, or monthly depending on whats going on otherwise. I also keep a record of things in do in a notion database and copy them over here. This helps to show interested parties about the things I do outside of work to keep me sharp. Sometimes its not enough to just say something or assume ppl will know/understand.

The repo is a set of .md files that follow a common template. Improving the practical application of practice problems (interviewing/competitive) involves retrospecting on the solution. As part of this retrospection, one should seek to improve their intuition in pattern recongnition. One video I love that really touches on this concept well is from Colin Galen (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f6N2UrCK6o) in which he talks about the difference between the "slow brain" and the "fast brain", in which the slow brain is the one you use for new concepts, which require effort. Conversly the fast brain is your intuition (like a cache) that you use from previous experience. Context switching between these two brains is improtant for solving tough problems, but you must treat these like a muscle and train them as such.
